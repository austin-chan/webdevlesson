	<p class="para" id="first"><strong>The two men</strong> are physically incongruous. Key is tall, light brown, dashingly high-cheek-boned, and L.A. fit; Peele is shorter, darker, more rounded, cute like a Teddy bear. Peele, who is thirty-five, <em>wears a nineties slacker uniform of sneakers</em>, hoodie, and hipster specs. Key is fond of sharply cut jackets and shiny shirts-like an ad exec on casual Friday-and looks forty-three the way Will Smith looked forty-three, which is not much. Before he even gets near hair and makeup, Key can play black, Latino, South Asian, Native American, Arab, even Italian. He is biracial, the son of a white mother and a black father, as is Peele. </p>

	<p class="para">But though Peele's phenotype is less obviously malleable-you might not guess that he's biracial at all-he is so convincing in voice and gesture that he makes you see what isn't really there. His Obama impersonation is uncanny, and it's the voice and hands, rather than the makeup lightening his skin, that allow you to forget that he looks nothing like the President. <strong>One of his most successful creations-a nightmarish</strong>, overly entitled young woman called Meegan-is an especially startling transformation: played in his own dark-brown skin, she somehow still reads as a white girl from the Jersey Shore.</p>

	<p>Between chameleonic turns, <em>the two men appear as themselves, casually introducing their sketches or riffing on them with a cozy intimacy,<em> as if recommending a video on YouTube, where they are wildly popular. A sketch show may seem a somewhat antique format, but it turns out that its traditional pleasures-three-minute scenes, meme-like catchphrases-dovetail neatly with online tastes.</p>
